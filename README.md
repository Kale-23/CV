# CV

this repo contains my CV and the code I used to create it

## Information

* `CV2.pdf`: final product.
* `CV2.rmd`: R markdown file to create the pdf.
* `awesome-cv.cls`: LaTeX file from [vitae](https://github.com/mitchelloharawild/vitae) that is in charge of overall style. I used an edited file from [Han Zhang's CV](https://github.com/HanZhang-psych/CV) that changes some text formats
* `apa-cv.csl`: APA 7th style from the [Zotero Style Repository](https://www.zotero.org/styles?q=id%3Aapa-cv). This file defines your citation style.
* `.bib` files: I have one `.bib` file that stores my presentation. You can create `.bib` files from your reference manager (e.g., Zotero) or from scratch. It's important that you create separate `.bib` files for separate sections of your CV such as Papers, Presentations, etc.
